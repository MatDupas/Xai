# Responsible Use Guidelines for Explainable Machine Learning
A proposal for a 180-minute hands-on tutorial at ACM FAT* 2020, Barcelona, Spain.  

All tutorial code and materials are available here: https://github.com/h2oai/xai_guidelines. All materials may be re-used and re-purposed, even for commerical applications, with proper attribution of the authors.

#### For the tutorial outline, please see: [responsible_xai.pdf](responsible_xai.pdf).

#### To use the code examples for this tutorial: 

1. Navigate to [https://aquarium.h2o.ai](https://aquarium.h2o.ai). 
2. Click `Create a new account` below the login. Follow the Aquarium instructions to create a new account.
3. Check the registered email inbox and use the temporary password sent there to login to Aquarium. 
4. Click `Browse Labs` in the upper left.
5. Find `Open Source MLI Workshop` and click `View Details`.
6. Click `Start Lab` and wait for several minutes as a cloud server is provisioned for you.  
7. Once your server is ready, click on the `Jupyter URL` at the bottom of your screen. 
8. Enter the token `h2o` at the top Jupyter security `Password or Token` text box.
9. Click the `xai_guidelines` folder. (For those interested, the `patrick_hall_mli` folder contains resources from a 2018 FAT* tutorial.)
10. You now have access to the tutorial materials. You may browse them at your own pace or wait for instructions. You may also come back to them at anytime using your Aquarium login.
